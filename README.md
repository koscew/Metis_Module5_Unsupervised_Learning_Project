# Metis\_Module5\_Unsupervised\_Learning\_Project


## Descripton

This is the fifth project of Metis Data Science Bootcamp. We are going to use data with primarily textual information to build unsupervised learning models that address a useful structure finding, topic modeling, and/or recommendation system problem. I planned to use the comments from board game players on BoardGameGeek to make a content-based board game recommendation system.
