The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases\\' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists\\' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__thumb/img/oqViRj6nVxK3m36NluTxU1PZkrk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1534148.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__original/img/IsrvRLpUV1TEyZsO5rC-btXaPz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1534148.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"333623\">Pandemic: Folded Space Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"538\">Z-Man Games</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"138572\">002: Thunderstarter</boardgamepodcastepisode>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"140761\">004: Live Coop &amp;amp; Improved Audio!</boardgamepodcastepisode>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"275272\">011 – Co-Op Mechanics to Encourage Teamplay in Card and Board Games</boardgamepodcastepisode>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"284469\">019 – Artificial Intelligence in Board Games – Part 2</boardgamepodcastepisode>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"95496\">1P 033 -

I cannot believe they overlooked that.\\n\\nAlso take a look at the Pandemic Legacy setup rules and Pandemic Cthulhu role selection. They make more sense. \\n\\nCarefully selected event cards and a more subtle setup/role selection turn this into a 10/10.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"0 1 1 2 3 5 8\" rating=\"N/A\">Why not, right?

I&#039;m in the middle of playing Legacy, however, and I&#039;m afraid that I won&#039;t want to play &quot;vanilla&quot; Pandemic after that. We shall see. \\n\\nAs far as Co-Ops go, the only real problem with base Pandemic is the tendency to have &quot;optimal plays&quot;, which almost negates any player feeling like they are truly in control of their turns. However, this was the game that taught me how to NOT be the &quot;alpha gamer&quot;, and let the game play out as it would in real life. That made the game much more enjoyable - even if it led to more defeats. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"13walker\" rating=\"7\">Thank you Secret Santa 2008!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"143245\" rating=\"5\">I really dig into the theme, but the QB issue has finally sucked some of my enjoyment out of the game. The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I&#039;d prefer. That said, I&#039;ll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don&#039;t see the entire problem space each game.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"16note\" rating=\"6\">Rachel&#039;s half</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1974vertigo2009\" rating=\"N/A\">NORMAL + SOLITARIO</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"19oldnewgamer53\" rating=\"7\">HNP</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1awesomeguy\" rating=\"9\">My favourite co-op game.

Game came in a nice box with nice components and the artwork looks good. Tried it solo a few times to learn the rules, and the experience was surprisingly good. I don&#039;t particularly enjoy solo gaming, but I think I prefer it to cooperative gaming. This one&#039;s no exception.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"42Cogs\" rating=\"8\">Very cool mechanics!  The processes of an &quot;outbreak&quot; feels as it should: stressful and in need of co-op strategy all the while keeping the fun in it.  Solid with 4 players.  Played a few sessions in solo mode and it seems to work as well.  Co-Op is heavy leaning.  In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a &quot;leader&quot; is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.  Of course, this is all based off the group and how each individual prefers play.  Highly suggest individuals that simply enjoy puzzle mechanics (problem solving systems) and like working together through the process.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"42Genie\" rating=\"N/A\">Both editions</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"42vines\" rating=\"8.9\">a cooperative game that is huge fun and very difficult. great play mechanics and player roles means no two games are going to be the same.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4Corners\" rating=\"7\">I need to play this more to properly evaluate it, but so far it looks like the best co-op game ever made, and second place isn&#039;t even close.

What do you want me to say about it, it&#039;s Pandemic? I won&#039;t play 2-player with her, though. \\n\\nI am finding Pandemic Legacy to be a whole lot more interesting, because your decisions carry over from game to game, and it communicates the tension of the theme more effectively. Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of &#039;objective&#039; cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh. \\n\\nBeyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock&#039;s games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn&#039;t do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it&#039;s frustrating that the game doesn&#039;t force you to come up with that plan together. \\n\\nIt&#039;s Pandemic. I have problems with the alpha-player tendency (which the game does nothing to curb) and the repetitiveness, but it&#039;s everyone&#039;s favorite co-op for a reason.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aalotr13\" rating=\"7.5\">Good co-op, but bad luck can ruin a game</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aandjso\" rating=\"6\">Not a bad game, but I don&#039;t like the theme... still don&#039;t!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aardrian\" rating=\"7\">I play a two person game as if it&#039;s four people.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aardvarkius\" rating=\"N/A\">New\\n\\nBIN: Not for sale/trade at this time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronCRdz\" rating=\"10\">I can´t describe it!
